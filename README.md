# <Rick's prework study guide>

## Description

This is a small study guide to help organize notes and practice my newly learned skills in coding. This will help me with my journey through learning these new languages and help keep things neat and organized. I learned everything from simple markdown to javascript learning HTML and CSS along the way.
